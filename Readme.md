# Reactlog 2.0: Debugging the State of Shiny

### Abstract

The revamped reactlog provides an updated visual display to traverse through the reactive behavior within your shiny application. Using live shiny applications, we will use reactlog’s directed dependency graph to find missing reactive dependencies in “working” applications and address suboptimal reactive coding patterns. Correcting these coding patterns will reduce the amount of calculations done by shiny and keep reactive objects from being created unnecessarily.
